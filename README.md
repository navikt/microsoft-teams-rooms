Microsoft Teams Rooms
=========
Solutions and examples for Microsoft Teams Rooms using [newly added Microsoft Graph APIs for Teams capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/teams-api-overview?view=graph-rest-beta), mainly focused on the ["Provisioned devices"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/teamworkdevice?view=graph-rest-beta) scope for now.

I also have some aspirations of migrating our basic setup (which is a non-coded solution) into code here, but time will tell if I have the time for it. ðŸ¤ž

# Get started
There should be a seperate README.md for each solution or example :)

# Inquiries
Questions related to this code or project can be created as issues here on GitHub

# Note about language
Proper form for this repository would probably be for me to skrive pÃ¥ Norsk (write in Norwegian), but seeing as this repository (almost) exclusively deals within the technical domain and is not really "customer facing", I have decided to maintain everything in English. I don't expect my code to be of much use to anyone, but hopefully maintaining everything in English will give this a wider reach to *maybe* optimize the reach and helpfulness.

Some parts will be in Norwegian *â€” like outbound messages to teams channels or alerts, â€”* but not code, comments or instruction unless I made a mistake :P
